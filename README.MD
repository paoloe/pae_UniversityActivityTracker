# University Activity Tracker

Currently I'm using an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of all the minutes I spend on each University module. It's worked great but it would be convenient if this was an application on my phone as sometimes I forget to clock out and when I do remember I have to turn on my laptop and open Excel just to clock out.

I have some great ideas for the app but the basic functionality will just be to save information about how much time I've spent on a module and view the records.

In the future I'm aiming to implement some cool visual data analytics as the home page of the app!
